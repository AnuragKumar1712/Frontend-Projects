**Project Title: Form Validation Webpage**

**Overview:**  
The "Form Validation" webpage is an interactive form that ensures proper user input validation before submission. It provides real-time feedback to users about the correctness of the entered data, preventing submission of incomplete or invalid information. This project is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on client-side validation.

**Key Features:**
- **Username Field:** The username field allows the user to input a valid name. It ensures that the field is not left empty by displaying an error message if skipped.
  
- **Email Validation:** The form checks if the email field contains a properly formatted email address. If not, an error message, "Email cannot be empty" appears, alerting the user to correct the input.
  
- **Password Requirements:** The password field ensures that the user enters a valid password. It must not be left blank, and if this happens, the form will display the message "Password cannot be empty."
  
- **Password Confirmation:** This field ensures that the user correctly re-enters the password. If it is left blank, a warning "Password Check cannot be empty" is shown. This prevents form submission without confirming the password.
  
- **User-Friendly Validation Messages:** Error messages are displayed beneath each field when the input is invalid, enhancing user experience by providing real-time feedback.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** Structuring the form with input fields for username, email, password, and password check.
- **CSS:** Styling the form to ensure a clean, responsive, and professional appearance. The gradient background (left-side red and right-side blue) adds visual appeal to the page.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing real-time validation logic to check for empty fields and ensuring proper input format.

**Use Case:**  
This webpage is ideal for applications that require account creation or user registration, ensuring that only valid and complete information is submitted.

**Future Improvements:**
- Integration with a backend system for server-side validation and form data handling.
- More advanced validation, such as checking password strength or email format using regular expressions.
