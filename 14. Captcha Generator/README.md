## Captcha Generator Webpage

### Project Description:

This project is a **Captcha Generator Webpage** designed to enhance security by generating a random captcha code that users must correctly enter to proceed. Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the webpage provides an effective and user-friendly interface for implementing captcha verification.

### Key Features:

1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - A clean and visually appealing design with a gradient background.
   - A prominently displayed captcha code that is easy to read but challenging enough to prevent automated bots from solving it.

2. **Captcha Generation:**
   - Generates a random alphanumeric captcha code each time the page is loaded or the refresh button is clicked.
   - The captcha code is displayed in a distinct style to ensure clarity and distinguishability.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - Captures user input for the captcha field and compares it against the generated code.
   - Provides real-time feedback on the captcha input, alerting users if the entered code does not match.
   - Includes a refresh button that allows users to generate a new captcha if the current one is unclear or difficult to read.

4. **Enhanced Usability:**
   - User-friendly form design with clear instructions and input fields.
   - Error handling for incorrect captcha entries, guiding users to re-enter the code if necessary.
   - Responsive layout ensures compatibility and usability across various devices, including desktops and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML5:** Structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS3:** Styling, including gradient background and text styling.
- **JavaScript:** Core logic for captcha generation, validation, and user interaction.

### Outcome:

The Captcha Generator Webpage provides an essential security feature by verifying human interaction through captcha codes. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate front-end technologies to create secure and user-friendly web applications, focusing on usability and effective security measures.
