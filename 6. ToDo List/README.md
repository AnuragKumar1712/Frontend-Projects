## To-Do List

### Project Overview:
The "To-Do List" webpage is a simple, interactive task management tool that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks efficiently. The intuitive design makes it easy for users to organize their daily activities by adding tasks to a list and deleting them once completed.

### Key Features:

1. Task Input: Users can enter tasks in a text box and click the "Add" button to list them in the To-Do List.
2. Task Display: Newly added tasks are displayed in a neat list format, each entry showing the task and a delete button.
3. Task Removal: Each task has a corresponding delete button, which allows users to remove a specific task from the list with a single click.
4. Minimalist Design: The interface is designed with a clean and simple aesthetic, ensuring easy readability and a distraction-free user experience.

### Technologies Used:

- HTML: Structuring the webpage with a task input field and a list display area.
- CSS: Styling the webpage to create an attractive, user-friendly layout, ensuring responsive design and clear task presentation.
- JavaScript: Enabling dynamic functionality such as adding new tasks to the list and removing tasks as needed.

### Use Case:
This webpage can be used by individuals looking for a simple task management tool to help organize their daily to-dos. It is ideal for personal use and can be expanded for team-based task management.

### Future Improvements:

1. Adding a feature to mark tasks as completed without removing them.
2. Integrating local storage to save tasks even after refreshing the page.
3. Implementing task categorization to organize tasks by priority or deadline.
